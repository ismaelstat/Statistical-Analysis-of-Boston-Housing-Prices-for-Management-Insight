Key Objectives and Statistical Methods UsedThe project successfully addressed the following managerial inquiries:Waterfront Value (T-test): Determined if a significant difference exists in the mean $\text{MEDV}$ for houses bounded by the Charles River ($\text{CHAS}$) versus those that are not.Age of Housing Impact (ANOVA): Assessed whether there is a statistical difference in $\text{MEDV}$ across three discrete groups defined by the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 ($\text{AGE}$).Environmental Correlation (Pearson Correlation): Tested for a linear relationship between Nitric Oxide concentrations ($\text{NOX}$) and the proportion of non-retail business acres ($\text{INDUS}$).Employment Proximity Effect (Linear Regression): Quantified the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers ($\text{DIS}$) on the $\text{MEDV}$.MethodologyThe project included:Task 2: Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations (boxplots, histograms, bar plots, scatter plots) to explore the distribution of key variables ($\text{MEDV}$, $\text{CHAS}$, $\text{PTRATIO}$) and the relationship between $\text{NOX}$ and $\text{INDUS}$.Task 3: Applying inferential statistical tests (T-test, ANOVA, Pearson Correlation, and Simple Linear Regression) with a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$ to formally test stated hypotheses and derive actionable conclusions for management.
